UMW has launched a new emergency alert system, UMW Alerts, but faculty, staff and students must register with the new system to customize their emergency notices the way they want to receive them.

If you are a student, faculty or staff member and want to choose the way by which you receive emergency notifications, please provide your name and email address below:

Once you submit the information, you will receive an email invitation and web link from Christopher Cash in Emergency Management and Safety inviting you to create an account. Once the account is created, please log in to the site and follow the instructions to customize how and in what order you prefer to receive the emergency noticesâ€”by text messages, UMW email, personal email, cell phone voice mail or alternate phone voice mail. Please make sure to save your changes.

When the University issues a notification about a potential emergency, safety hazard or concern, you will receive a message on the voice or text communication methods for which you have registered. Please confirm that your have receive the message and you will not be contacted by subsequent methods regarding that particular notification, If you do not confirm, the system will continue to attempt to reach you through all the paths for which you have registered.

If you already have registered and want to make updates to your account, please do so here.

Please Note: At this time, the alert system is not available to anyone outside the UMW community. The emergency notification system will be available to those outside the UMW community at a later date.
